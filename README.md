# VSDSquadron-Mini-Research-Internship

As part of my internship, I'm currently working with the **VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V Development Kit**, a robust platform built on the RISC-V architecture. This project offers an opportunity to dive into embedded systems, exploring how RISC-V integrates into various development workflows. I'm gaining practical, hands-on experience with its core features while applying cutting-edge techniques in embedded system design.

## TASK-1

### LAB-1
The first task assigned was to write a C program that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n using gEDIT as a Text Editor.
